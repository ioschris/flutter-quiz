# flutter-quiz
This is a simple quiz application developed in Flutter. This project is apart of the *Udemy* course [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide 2021 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) and can be found in Section 2! I then added other features into the application that were not covered in the section such as a score counter, a question counter, a response to whether the answer is correct or not, etc. I also changed the theme of the quiz with the help of my girlfriend in creating all of the questions. Her and I have been watching *The 100* religiously and I found it only right to combine what I love with something she loves.
